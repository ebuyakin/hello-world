So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress is not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care, or the one to be loved to help them make a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the medical decisions and in fact for the decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the fact that we would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even you may be able to know people that are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not about the doctor, and if it's somebody else's fault is from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> what you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help one person help you.
300.
This is the research on the research for the cynical <unk> research and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, or a brain attack or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the prescription of all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and you have to be asked by the <unk> <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are made by <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they're thinking, "People five percent are not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress they don't think clearly.
So think about how we can do this with time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent of consent consent of consent consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You might be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number you need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the older men of 50, breast cancer, number you need to deal with is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has been <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you get luck, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects to just run a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions you can make that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option a lot of times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you go off a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> on face with a predator, it's not necessary the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, doesn't react very rapidly. They might be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out of the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought -- as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail then.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize damage, or to avoid the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of input in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots and lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I've not read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite favorite student.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never get to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language came over the decade in 1800, and over the time of time, it was mixed with local signs, and the language of the way we now meet as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world, is as if I lived in a foreign country -- following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do you understand the bar.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise about eating the potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't know -- the covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about the one that's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
Get rid of decide.
<unk> to go on.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines are already carrying sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had been working like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and a spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend, and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was shocked by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, social currency social.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could get it to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you about it.
I chose to get me angry.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> your voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value in something like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound as my new art means <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and to express on the paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> what it means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like sound.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, which is that you get better to understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into many different <unk>
If you're mapping a different parameter for each finger while the facial expression, the movement, the <unk> the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so, while the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you get a key thing at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> they need the 10 fingers to express a concept of course.
If only a key key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign and the sun comes out and you put it.
This is all day."
If you get it, and you put it down, the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time we express time in <unk> and how the distance in the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, let's go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of your hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much on the head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second I would like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third one. Please go back again.
And again, again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they say very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and rich, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very strict world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't automatically have a social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear music to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of it, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to help you open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And they never knows, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a kid, my parents were saying, "Can you get it all right, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence or a bubble of ignorance to say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the other people.
Time passed, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots and lots of trash.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we have to collect those pieces of plastic in order to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use these huge boats
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And they will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic -- just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot of with the robots.
And then we started what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned down and turned on a little floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic chunks floating through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this <unk> invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will get it even further.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I do my problem with my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news -- <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water that they spread out is the water where the water is going to be.
You can also see that water is brown and the oil and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can be made through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> <unk> which can help you identify what is in the water.
So we had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help shape other children.
I was forced to research a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half French and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it began several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a minute.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a central nuclear power <unk>
And today, according to the average reports for an average of 300 tons are still filtering from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it looks safe and it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and deals with other scientists, the land, the soil -- and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course not <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night you go to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of masks as well.
It might seem like they didn't get serious work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust would spread from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest nuclear expedition to date.
We get to 1.5 miles of the nuclear power station, and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem on a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a very small industrial installation in the meantime, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we converted into the larger space of social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong metal, and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, basically you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become really a help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We were asking things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of old age transforming its standard wheels into new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen citizens, creators, <unk> we must prepare the next generation for us to worry about the environment and people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is <unk> on the environment, the other ever believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble marble <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information that has been required for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made from parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects, in thinking of their objects like <unk> from <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mostly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here is a broken screen that represents the <unk> of the world and an architect and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene, of the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My job, at its simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, from the assembly and getting to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible that it was 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you get four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe we create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, and tools and tools through scales, scale, with a very grasp of 24 meters in diameter with a database that someday never very far from print <unk> and graphics at the nanoscale <unk> made of genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is unique to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second <unk> skin that was made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing, we print this layer and 3D skirt with no seams between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner, too.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and to the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair -- a comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter <unk> my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern of surface it becomes <unk>
We put this out of this 44 different properties -- which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, changes their functionality not by addition to addition to other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious village, religious home, but when my grandmother was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and actually define a lot of what matters to me.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, including leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land took trees to grow up with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made from a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material to put the material in the <unk> material with fruit, and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms as shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune in their properties, we could generate structures that could be built into one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of seed husks -- the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical <unk> we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material in the march and create these structures made from only three material -- 100 percent recyclable stuff.
When the pieces are lists, they let it dry up to find a natural form to the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles were a byproduct of the printing process of printing <unk> which was used for the first time on the planet three billion years ago as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their <unk> <unk> problems to mesh -- and if it gets <unk> even further.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with a old stuff, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects that are designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help rise to a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just instead of <unk> metals -- and we have new biological policies inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothing, you get two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
She lives in our oceans and the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other sugar takes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel which looks like the <unk> tract that will help us get these bacteria and to make them <unk> their function function.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, and we can get the properties of the material in the <unk> functionality as well.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent channels.
This is <unk> digestive system when it stretches from one end to each other, it involves 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our little <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels -- brilliant channels with life within my clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are working creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the hard matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, the fabric of their skin and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer printing material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture home within which it was <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers together.
And this is all over scales.
The silk worm is set up in the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of better understanding how this complex process, we glue a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, and we realized that it was <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different across different parts of us, and we've discovered that form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They're often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape <unk> silk silk only <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
This is how we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot that we had making lots of silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that these worms of silk silk, and <unk> and so we use a <unk> diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, it is distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We wanted to <unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to match us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as it was <unk> <unk> and <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
When we put biological silk on spider silk <unk> they give all this pavilion all its integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we put <unk> of silk <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, designers need to bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a inspired design in nature to an inspired nature of design, which requires us, for the first time, that let's take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and I had place sites -- and also, he played the guitar on a male band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it out.
But then I was excited about something else, a totally different thing, and I was going to get stuck on it, and I have to get <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again that I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me because of nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be slim or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like you to ask you something that I'd like to have happened then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate meaning of evil or abnormal meaning to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> learned from culture.
So we ask ourselves what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you would <unk>
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
I would get the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question is about again and again as we grow up in various ways, and they would get back to high school students ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise, from before you take away the dream.
Why?
If this question inspired kids to dream with what they might be, is not inspired to dream everything you might be.
In fact, it does just the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though they are good <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor would look at <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative failure.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling -- the idea that every one of us has something that I have to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show her curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that frame.
And so you can feel itself.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And you feel something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so to say.
It could help you split three parts: multiple parts, potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms, which will be <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance age, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> yourself.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or distress that you should win.
But what I've learned from talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers
One, the synthesis synthesis.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea for its <unk> mix skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their backgrounds, they can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> superpower, is the fast learning.
When we put them together, we are interested in it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was many times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to try and test things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to every new zone that we can see -- so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> to full-time and <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability helps to write compelling <unk> for the editors.
<unk> it's a loss of time to go to what you would get to you even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> superpower, is adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, others, a web designer, sometimes a consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Magazine Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if you're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The acoustician can dive deep and put in practice, ideas, and the <unk> offers an breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But all of us should design lives and careers that are dealing with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> are largely told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once you say this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, --  I'm like, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
They turn the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a <unk> and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they led to a psychiatric psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> because of it until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy that never had seen before.
What's even more surprising.
If you were <unk> I would have been living today, we could not give her more help than that he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral people for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been moved on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists that work to find a cure cure for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's disease now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include a lot of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their years now, with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be dear Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, health care, costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
So today is the most expensive disease and its cost -- a <unk> increase in five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The United States government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar rate of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of scientists, even scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a young old brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to spark a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease, significantly life expectancy and always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds as an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> <unk> end up.
But sometimes things come wrong, and some dots <unk> stay outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug to do it.
Until recently, in its most part of the wires have been reduced and waited for the better.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that <unk> specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move normally.
And these days, on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick into each other within them, as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs on these worms -- in an early stage, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive background, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that he grows that hope, of overcoming the Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we can see it -- we can afford it.
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have taken more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the drug industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit of overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times column in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience of testing it just one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers will become <unk> to make 36 questions more personal and then both you look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number four: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would you be?
Number <unk> When did it be the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number four: <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like to him, or it was, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you won't say to someone you've just known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, a little detail that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we got it up, and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send her to the spinal cord for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably wonder, do they keep going.
And the reason I think the question is asking this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book over the last few years, so I had led me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually about my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand of them.
And that came up a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it no idea.
The paper was published on Friday on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday had been called "Today <unk> and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million people, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing by writing about own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that loving life has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were named or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: do still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And a number of messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
And even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I tried to test them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
I had TV interviews, and I would take the orders of photos of us two.
I think it was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons in the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at all of it <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked it worked, they wanted to know if it was actually able to make <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love -- love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't really feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and he felt, mostly people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 times less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the research was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal students, using university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Sounds simple, right?
But the study did work.
Participants felt more close after doing so, several later studies, they also used the <unk> protocol of <unk> as a rapid way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community, and they used it to be used among people in <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately they never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person who I read it.
Well, he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to test the research better.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to almost my whole life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I brought to science.
And I did everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected that that could be some <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just went to the book that I would write but in hindsight, it really looks like <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, she would never have to feel as bad and used to me and sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what it comes from.
But I can also see me most clearly and I can tell you that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably what you can demand me.
What I look for love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to mitigate something about the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that is, still still together?
And their content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, I want you to ask questions about questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How would you stay in in love when things become <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year -- and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still still together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little way to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was not considered anything that was supposed to be.
It didn't mean how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, and I want to love someone who is kind and fun and fun and expressed that choice in the greatest newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we would expect, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and is <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian in the mountain and in a certain way I came up as a forest <unk>
And in New York City a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I put a <unk> ticket a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species are <unk> for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's very happy because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment he was in <unk> <unk> like to go from board and do <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could be <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite -- somehow it seemed to be <unk> as if it was that they would <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, these strange bottles that I would find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can show you <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals -- <unk>
First of all, let's make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of resin from natural size with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to the drawing on a window, and then another window, and he had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of view.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work would be done with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired largely in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double their face, so they're 10 meters away.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures are in animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation -- this <unk> mesh of <unk> where it comes up.
Here is where creatures with animals in animals are headed to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform for Osama bin Laden, and there are all kinds of rare things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
It's also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and spits out oil in one hand, while the other hand is coming out of the other hand.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That is the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> line of a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
But anyway, his tail makes fire on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I spent that.
Things that go -- you know.
Your tail ends up in a eyeball and <unk> cards made from 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material would be <unk> dictionaries or magazine ...
But each of you acts as a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. I'm taking them years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs kilos of pounds with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> is the chest, you can <unk> the entrance to it.
I will see them for the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall coming out of the chest, and it takes the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This is two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There's a few pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue out.
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity cavity inside.
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box -- it's called <unk> <unk>
In this box, there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is the box and the box that's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is going to be effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> -- any drug will spread.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> they have to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the count of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side effects that are <unk> in their most negative time, because in the time it takes it to get to the current -- you get worse and worse for the time that it takes to get it to your destination, which is where it's more important -- in the HIV pandemic.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go in the bloodstream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a wastewater treatment that is a lifetime of life.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "We would get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care about wounds and surgery, they can be used for anything else -- including the transportation of the drugs that are <unk>
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and they closed almost immediately cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane to HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts through the cell, while the cell will absorb the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even count, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the place of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every single researcher of the <unk> in our case, a little bit <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> domestic organizations as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
What these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the best of these violence agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> even we should be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know that the reasons why they want to do it, but no one look at what they do when they didn't get to it.
The armed struggle and policies.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military machine.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks -- against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
It was a complicated machine of communication stations and radio channels, online channels, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the print <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
Young groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Consumers also do something else: they create stronger ties to their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Local groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that is not safe and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn through war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> it can also understand the efforts of these groups by giving security security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, safety has a price spike high for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006, the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at the groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid together.
<unk> because they fill gaps around the government, and they come up with armed groups, political and political struggle with violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of its <unk> to collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids, and the more weak are the states, like the Middle East -- the more witness and they fill that gap and the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the U.S. tools.
<unk> that government emptiness has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace in peace.
If we understand better groups more likely to understand what incentives to offer the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safety vacuum gap.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the sticker of <unk> it would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I loved myself as a bad feminist feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call him the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had some strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and to <unk> sex. Like that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> which might be feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a very taboo and disgusting.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually the woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world like <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use easy and accessible to contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our own social condition and skills and a lot more.
We have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths to be <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive a job, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Even though the letter embraces women and I'm <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm totally <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do --   -- all the <unk> tasks, but I also kill insects -- the collection of <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales, they make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it is her choice, and I am not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home for raising their children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that women are economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, men and gay and <unk> for women white <unk> and high and high.
Listen, if that's good Feminism I'm a very bad feminist feminist here.
It also happens as this: as <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be perfection.
When we were excited about it with a lot of fun from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be a <unk> before trying to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid of standing and say, "Yes, I am a fear of fear of what that word means is that it would not be able to fulfill the quiet expectations.
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it the <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist feminist ...
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> 10 meters tall.
It was a show. It was going to look at this star <unk> star, and to know the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started massively debates if it was <unk> or not any feminist <unk>
It was <unk> instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, we need a lot.
We're going to go so much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> Feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, one more inclusive Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to <unk> and will be a little more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively affecting their profit.
No doubt is hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions can justify it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
They're two girls who are <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also so brave. I want to grow in a world.
It's where they were told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the canal when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the other part of the movie when movies don't treat women more than as objects that are <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, to participate in your project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as a decision to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also push it to be even more as even more like us to be forced to overcome the barriers to the streets.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little courage of courage and hope that our decisions will be going to the top, and the people in the power CEOs and film and music, <unk> -- the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, more courageous, to create a sustainable and significant change.
We can also claim to make the courage good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't care about it that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and art, I also discovered that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And in the other one, I claim the outrageous reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad women: I'm a good woman, I'm trying to make my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when more you need to be able to have a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because they visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this from more half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists than the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, you know, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it create all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were stable just three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> business as <unk> <unk> -- they refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could read it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If vaccines are not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating global impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> on Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article describing 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> worlds -- <unk> people around them, including their own parents.
They could amuse him during hours by waving her hands up before their faces, but they were prey to panic like when you don't put his favorite toy into their usual place without knowing it.
Over the basis of patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that it had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we have <unk> references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to the <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he complained that he had become nine of every 10 kids sent from other doctors to his doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> which is caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been carefully in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite albums he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills claiming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents forced to win their approval decline.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started to test the <unk> theory of autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist, and I thought the theory of mothers called <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were <unk> warm and <unk> and they had a profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as black-eyed <unk> no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families -- Judith <unk> decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence from autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw in clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ...
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit very cute and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he would get <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation to the English, but luckily, <unk> husband was German, and he was putting it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching kids were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and children followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabled <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, they called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the developing methods of education that were especially suited to them.
Now, who was referred to autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of growth and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and people have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural culture as known as awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, to success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and the early 1990s, their changes in <unk> -- <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a wide and <unk> model.
These changes were not going into broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked on <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, teachers all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced the first easy clinical tests to use to diagnose autism.
I wasn't supposed to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it were, so it was, what the people with autism and their families will finally support the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple, <unk> history of credible history as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the preventing center one in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, <unk> -- people are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they're kind of puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social, and it's a deficit deficit for details.
No doubt people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> that creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
